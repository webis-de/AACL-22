"the argument here is that sociological factors are more important than the availability of weapons in determining gun violence and deaths in societies   guns don t kill people   people kill people, criminals often decide to shoot a citizen only after the citizen pulls out a gun in  self defense   this occurs with burglars that may have had no intention of harming anyone  but whom feel they must defend themselves when a citizen pulls out a gun  fatal exchanges often occur because an innocent person decides to draw out a gun on an assailant, legal boundaries for gun ownership may not provide sufficient social protections  as many criminals steal legally owned guns  and commit violent crimes or murder with them  these criminals would have greater difficulty in obtaining such weapons if firearms were generally less prevalent in society  in other words  it is argued that the world would be safer with fewer guns  and laws that lead to fewer guns by restricting the right of gun ownership  reducing the prevalence of guns reduces crime, guns in a household can actually provide an incentive for criminals to break into a house  increasing the risks for gun owners  therefore  gun ownership can be self defeating  as citizens purchase guns for self defense only to find that their home  property  and lives are at greater risk  burglars often break into houses to steal guns, guns are not the only means of violence and crime  determined criminals will find a way to do what they intend  depriving guns to criminals will not have an effect on crime and violence  criminals will find a way to commit crimes and violence with or without guns, some groups maintain that there is a correlation between the laxity of a country s gun laws and its suicide rate   not because gun owners are more depressive  but because the means of quick and effective suicide is easily to hand  guns make suicide too easy argument, legal gun owners frequently commit murder with their legally owned gun  this happened at hungerford and dunblaine in the u k  this may indicate that legal gun ownership is not a sufficient social protection against the lethal potential of guns  legal gun owners sometimes turn their gun on others, in homes with guns  a member of the household is almost three times as likely to be the victim of a homicide compared to gun free homes  households with guns have a much greater risk of homicide",1,411,87.01,53.13,26.13,1,411,24.09,88.32,61.8,48.91,6.08,2.19,0,0,0.24,0,1.7,3.89,14.6,8.03,0.24,15.09,7.54,3.89,5.84,1.46,12.65,9.49,2.68,7.06,0.24,0.73,6.33,14.36,0.73,13.63,2.92,2.19,1.22,3.65,0.24,3.89,0,10.22,0.97,9.25,1.22,0,1.22,0,0.97,0.24,0,13.38,5.35,0,0,2.43,1.95,0.97,7.3,0.73,0,0,0,0.97,0.97,0,0,2.19,0,1.95,0,0.24,0,3.89,0.97,0,0,0.97,0,0,0.24,2.92,0.49,0,0.97,0.24,0.49,0,0.24,1.46,0,5.35,8.03,0.24,0.73,6.08,0,0,0.24,2.19,1.46,5.11,1.7,0.49,0.49,0.24,0,0,1.7,0,1.7,0,0,0,0

"dc is very small and very close to maryland and virginia  making it very easy for people to legally purchase guns outside of dc and bring them in  it also makes it very easy for blackmarket sales to occur  the dc handgun ban is made ineffectual by legal purchases in maryland and virginia, since the handgun ban was first implemented in 1976  more than 8 400 people have been murdered in the district  this is a fairly dramatic figure and demonstrates that the ban has not had a substantive effect in reducing crime rates  the dc handgun ban has not really decreased crime and murders in dc, according to the statements of the dc police that an overwhelmingly amount of the homicides have been committed with handguns  this goes to show that even though the law has been enforced the harms have still occurred through the inevitable availability of guns  the handgun ban is ineffective at stopping handguns homicides, when citizens have guns  criminals fear committing crimes due to the risk that they will be shot  many studies indicate that this deterrent effect decreases violent crime rates  the correlation is not surprising  citizen gun ownership acts as a deterrent against criminals, there are a range of ways to decrease gun crime and murder in a city  including greater background checks  making sure that bad people don t get guns  more police patrols  and various other alternatives  these steps should be taken before a ban  as a ban may be much more intrusive into the constitutional rights of citizens  alternative measures can be taken in place of a ban to stem crime and murder, the present large amount of guns within the us society and the even larger black market of guns provides the proof that inevitably post any banning of guns they will still be present in society  their existence will be confined to an illegal paradigm where law abiding citizens will not have access  that will put them at the risk of loosing their lives by being without means of self protection  the handgun ban prevents law abiding citizens from self defense, the examples of washington dc and new york show that with a gun ban law they are one of the most dangerous cities within the us  this leads to the conclusion that reality should have reinforced the reasoning that gunning bans provides more safety to the public  absent of this confirmation one can argue that banning guns is not an effective way of ensuring public safety   cities that have gun ban laws enacted are not significantly safer, the methodology of the studies has proven to be flawed  this goes to show that when arguments are supported by studies that support that the murder rate has decreased their validity and reliability is undermined by a flawed methodology  studies that have showed the murder rate has decreased were flawed",1,480,81.38,36.48,8.11,1,480,23.75,80.63,61.25,50.21,7.29,1.67,0,0,0,0,1.67,5.63,17.29,9.17,1.25,13.13,10.21,3.96,4.38,1.25,14.17,6.46,5.42,3.96,0,1.04,3.13,8.33,0,8.13,1.25,2.08,0.83,1.04,0.83,2.92,0,7.5,1.46,5.83,1.46,0,1.25,0.42,0.63,0,0,7.92,3.75,0.42,0,2.29,0.42,0.42,3.54,0,0,0,0,1.88,1.88,0,0,1.88,0,0,0.83,0.83,0.21,2.08,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,1.67,0,0,1.04,0.21,0,0,0,1.67,0,3.96,7.92,1.04,1.04,4.58,1.25,0,0,1.46,2.08,5.63,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,0,1.46,0,0,0,0
